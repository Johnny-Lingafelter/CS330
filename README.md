# CS330

How do I approach designing software?
  
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  
   Working on this project has helped me with my organizational skills and led me to think about the overall architecture of my code more thoroughly. OpenGL programs require a great deal of code, and a project can quickly become a mess if things are not organized correctly.
  
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  
   The design process I followed would be most akin to iterative development, similar to sprints in SCRUM/Agile methodology. I would constantly test my code when small changes were made to ensure that the program was behaving as expected and that no bugs were introduced because of the changes.
  
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  
   Truthfully, the skills associated with design that I learned and honed in this class will be useful for every project I undertake from this point forward. My learning experience is an aggregate of everything I have learned in the past, and I expect that to continue for as long as I work with computer science.

How do I approach developing programs?
  
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  
   The main development strategy I used while working on my scene was to learn by example. I used the CS330 tutorials heavily, and I became very familiar with the code. I learned to adapt the code and to know where to change things when I needed different results.
  
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  
   Iterative development is basically the only way I develop anything at this point. It is the only sane way that I can work on a project. For my 3D scene, I was constantly changing small parts of the program here and there, and then immediately running the code to make sure that the changes provided the expected results.
  
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
   My approach evolved greatly within the first three weeks working on the milestones. At first I would put the tutorial code for the week into my project and then import my existing project into the week's code. But this was slow and painful. I soon learned that doing the opposite was the best approach. I kept my project the same and would take pieces of code from the week's tutorial that was relevant and put that into my project code. This worked much better for me, and in the end I was able to finish my project with bits and pieces of code from every week's tutorial.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

   As I am nearing the end of my CS journey, I appreciate the things that this course has taught me. Looking ahead at the course material is very beneficial for me, and I wish I would have done even more of that in this course. This course was the most difficult one I have had yet here at SNHU, but I believe it was also the most helpful.
 
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

   The things I learned in this course apply to any future career I may have. Graphics aside, I feel like the main benefit of this course was learning an entire framework and API, which happened to be OpenGL. This skill is invaluable for my future. There will always be the need to be able to come into an existing framework and understand what is going on and what makes it work. Learning how OpenGL works was much different from other frameworks I have worked with, but the concept of discovery and understanding was still the same.
